DataArt is a custom software development firm that builds advanced solutions for the [financial](http://www.dataart.com/industry/financial-software) services, [healthcare](http://www.dataart.com/industry/medical-software-development), [hospitality](http://www.dataart.com/industry/online-travel-solutions) and [media & entertainment](http://www.dataart.com/industry/publishing-software) industries. Combining domain knowledge with offshore cost advantages and resource flexibility, DataArt develops industry-defining applications, helping clients optimize time-to-market and minimize software development risks in mission-critical systems. With an unrivaled talent pool of highly skilled software engineers in New York, London, Russia and Ukraine, DataArt provides the technical skill, accountability and industry knowledge needed to deliver custom applications on time and on budget.

Our delivery and client engagement process is based on three key principles:

**Software is People's Business**

The measure of success is not the check in the bank, but the end user's adoption of the new system

**By the People**

A strong, well-organized team is key. We are fluent in the most sophisticated project methodologies, but deeply believe that it all comes down to two teams – ours and client's, respecting and bringing the best in each other. We do not believe in people-independent delivery processes. Instead, we create an environment where people are motivated to stay and perform

**Humble, long term-focused vendor is worth two greedy ones**

We invest in relationships with our clients, by putting our own resources upfront to explore the new systems, fine-tune client-specific processes and mitigate risks

We Make it Easy to Engage and Change Course as Needed

####We Bleed Agile!

**Business Level Approach**

We consider a project to be successful only when business stakeholders see the value of the investments required to complete the development. To ensure that the business needs are properly addressed we always align the project goals and timelines with the business goals

**Execution Level Approach**

We see the strength of DataArt's service in our ability for efficient problem solving rather than working under the tight control of day-by-day supervision by the customer. This means that the engagement structure should include not only the development services but also such components as discovery, solution proof of concept, ongoing support and improvements

**Continuous Delivery**

The Continuous Delivery approach is at the heart of DataArt's Delivery Model, providing a flexible but reliable framework for project execution and delivery. The key feature of the approach is an optimized delivery cycle so that changes can be implemented quickly and the results can become reliable and predictable
Roughly, 60% of projects employ the method at present and the number is growing. DataArt coaches, Delivery Managers and Senior PMs attend Agile-focused events, such as the annual Agilee Eastern Europe.


From Idea to Implementation in 8 Steps with DataArt

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/dataart_img2.png">

**1. Enquiry**

You send us your idea in any shape and form and we contact you in the next 24-hours for a quick interview.

**2. Estimate**

We analyze collected information and come back to you with initial ballpark estimate and engagement plan. This may take several days, during which we stay in close contact with you to discuss new ideas, clarify requirements and inform you about our progress. Our goal here is to give you enough information to assess feasibility of the project as quickly as possible.

**3. Discovery**

Having engagement plan agreed and approved we start discovery phase during which we study your project requirements, environment and processes in-depth. This will result in a 360-view of the future project that includes functional requirements, architectural solution, development roadmap, project staffing, infrastructure, duration and costs, communication plan and project governance model. In many cases we prefer discovery phase to start with a series of face-to-face meetings to maximize efficiency of communications and establish personal contact. For that, our key project personnel will come to your premises or we'll be equally happy to see you in one of our offices. Depending on size of the project this phase may take from 1 to 6 weeks.

**4. Contract**

We send you development contract and begin assembling project team. We understand that contract negotiation can take a while and in many cases we start setting up project infrastructure long before paperwork is actually completed to keep the momentum.

**5. Production**

This is where all technical work takes place. We believe that open communication is the key to success of any project, regardless of its size, methodology or technology chosen. We'll do everything to build and maintain that "one goal, one team" culture in the project team and we expect the same from you.

**6. Launch**

We'll be there for you when you launch your product whether it is consumer-oriented or enterprise solution. We'll be glad to help you choose hosting platform and develop safe deployment procedures. We'll even take a night shift on launch day to ensure smooth start of your product or perform deployment over weekend to minimize impact on your business.

**7. Support**

Even simplest software projects require maintenance and support. We understand that and we are always ready to provide post-production support if necessary in addition to our standard warranty period.

**8. Hand-over**

When the time comes for us to step aside, we will provide all necessary resources to perform smooth and seamless handover of the project to your team. We'll help your staff to get up to speed with project deliverables and infrastructure and we'll always stay just one phone call away to answer your questions.
