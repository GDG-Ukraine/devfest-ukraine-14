  description: "Google TV was an early but premature attempt to extend android out of the phone. Google Glass took that a step further by providing a new UI, UX and APIs. Now with Android Wear, Android has extended to a new environment which is much adoptable than Glass. However, Wear comes with a price, with wear once again we have new UI, UX and set of APIs.<br>This talk intends to give a deep dive into whole new UI, UX and development tools introduced by Android L, Android Wear and the Google Glass showing ways to integrate each and offer a smooth flow between all android platforms."

  description: "Based on the stats gathered by imaginarynumbers inc., 49% of Java developers wouldn't code Java anymore if not Guava.<br>In fact, Guava is a wonderful library that makes Java development easier and friendlier.

By carefully drawing the boundaries of the cross-platform and platform specific components you don't even have to give up the natural platform user experience. We will look at how these parts can be connected using the Android NDK / SDK through some real life examples."

I decided to send my idea to Google Science Fair. One day I received fantastic news. I was selected to 90 regional finalists. I added more efforts. Finally my robo-microscope had 3 optical systems and 4 servo motors. It has option of remote control and integration with Google Hangouts. At the same time it's still Lego construction which can be cloned in any school. I took final battle with all my 'ammunition' in Google HQ, Mountain View, September 24, 2014. It was hard battle.
