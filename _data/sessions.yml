  description: "Google TV was an early but premature attempt to extend android out of the phone. Google Glass took that a step further by providing a new UI, UX and APIs. Now with Android Wear, Android has extended to a new environment which is much adoptable than Glass. However, Wear comes with a price, with wear once again we have new UI, UX and set of APIs.<br>This talk intends to give a deep dive into whole new UI, UX and development tools introduced by Android L, Android Wear and the Google Glass showing ways to integrate each and offer a smooth flow between all android platforms."

And many conferences have around 8-10% women visibility at most. Some researches also show while conferences with the soft subject matter such as user experience, web design has more women speakers and attendees, hight tech conferences have low woman proportions. The focus of this speech is on attempts to give more visibility to women at high-tech conferences.

I decided to send my idea to Google Science Fair. One day I received fantastic news. I was selected to 90 regional finalists. I added more efforts. Finally my robo-microscope had 3 optical systems and 4 servo motors. It has option of remote control and integration with Google Hangouts. At the same time it's still Lego construction which can be cloned in any school. I took final battle with all my 'ammunition' in Google HQ, Mountain View, September 24, 2014. It was hard battle.
