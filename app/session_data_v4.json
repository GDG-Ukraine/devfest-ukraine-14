            "description": "Google TV was an early but premature attempt to extend android out of the phone. Google Glass took that a step further by providing a new UI, UX and APIs. Now with Android Wear, Android has extended to a new environment which is much adoptable than Glass. However, Wear comes with a price, with wear once again we have new UI, UX and set of APIs.This talk intends to give a deep dive into whole new UI, UX and development tools introduced by Android L, Android Wear and the Google Glass showing ways to integrate each and offer a smooth flow between all android platforms.",

However, many developers limit its usage to simple Collections' transformations and filters, not revealing many advantages coming with the whole lib.During my presentation I'll also cover some android-specific topics like:- Guava your ContentResolverish boilerplate- 65K method limit hurts your app and Guava uses too many? Different approaches of handling this issue.- Do's and dont's of Guava for Android.And more!",

In the Chrome world, these tools are called Chrome Extensions.During my presentation, I will demonstrate several extensions I have built. I will explain how I built them.

Some researches also show while conferences with the soft subject matter such as user experience, web design has more women speakers and attendees, hight tech conferences have low woman proportions. The focus of this speech is on attempts to give more visibility to women at high-tech conferences. The experiences and challenges of a member of a community that organises conferences with the around 50% of women inclusion and solutions will be presented.",
