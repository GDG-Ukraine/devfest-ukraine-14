  title: "Front-End Tools Beyond DevTools"
  description: "Every front-end developer knows that Chrome DevTools rocks! It is a primary tool we work with every day. Mastering it is a must. Yet there is more to the story. Real front-end craftspersons don't use a multi-tool for every task. Instead, they use a set of specialised tools to make their work more efficient. In the Chrome world, these tools are called Chrome Extensions.<br><br>During my presentation, I will demonstrate several extensions I have built. I will explain how I built them. You'll not only learn about new tools, but you will also see how easy it is to create them!"
